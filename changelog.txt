V RF.01.11 (2015-12-23)
- Fixing of compiler errors in case FEATURE_MILLING_MODE was set to 0 for the RF1000 variant of the firmware.
- Adding of a timeout so that continuePrint() can not block the further execution of G-Codes forever.
- Improved handling of RF1000 installations where the z-min and z-max endstops are within the same circuit.
  - After disabling of the steppers, the firmware could be unable to determine whether the z-min or the z-max endstop is pressed.

V RF.01.10 (2015-12-14)
- At this moment, this firmware is identical to the firmware from the master branch.
- This firmware can be compiled for the RF1000 and for the RF2000.
  - Switch the value for "MOTHERBOARD" within Configuration.h between "DEVICE_TYPE_RF1000" and "DEVICE_TYPE_RF2000" in order to compile the proper variant of the firmware.
  - In case the wrong firmware is loaded (= the RF1000 firmware at the RF2000 board or the RF2000 firmware at the RF1000 board), the firmware beeps 4 times after the start and does not perform any other tasks.
  - The following device configurations are supported:
    - RF1000 + single extruder
    - RF1000 + miller
    - RF2000 + dual extruder
- The following modifications apply to both variants of the firmware:
  - The displayed x/y/z positions within the display of the device are the current position (according to the so-far performed steps) now (and not the last calculated position from the queue of commands).
  - The z offset which can be configured via M3006 also can be changed via the menu now.
  - All menu entries have been reviewed.
  - A separate counter for the operating hours in operating mode "mill" has been added.
  - A service interval has been added which can inform about the amount of time which is left until the next service should be performed.
    - In case the print/mill shall be canceled via the menu, an additional question is displayed in order to avoid unintentional abortions.
  - In case the firmware shall be restarted via the menu, an additional question is displayed in order to avoid unintentional restarts.
  - The menu text which requests to turn on the miller could be displayed too short.
  - The currently mounted extruder type can be configured via the menu.
  - The currently mounted miller type can be configured via the menu.
  - Pausing via M3070 S2 can move away from the work part also in operating mode mill now.
  - The speed of the x/y/z movements during pause and continue operations has been improved.
  - The speed of x/y/z movements which are performed via the hardware buttons and via the menu has been improved.
  - In case "Unload Filament" or "Load Filament" are called via the menu and the extruder is cold at the moment, the extruder is heated up before the requested operation is performed.
  - The minimal and maximal strain gauge digits which trigger the emergency pause can be configured via M3075 Ss Pp now.
  - The status text could show "Heating Extruder" even in case the setpoint temperature after M109 was 0°.
  - The "Position Extruder" menu items could allow to move the cold extruder.
  - The two present "Position Z" menus could show a slightly different behavior when the Z position was close to the z-max endstop.
  - In case the z-max endstop is reached through a manual movement of the z-axis (either via the hardware buttons or via the menu), the z axis moves a short distance upwards automatically in order to free the z-endstop again.
  - The handling of invalid commands like "U1" has been improved so that the firmware can continue to process further (correct) commands.
  - FEATURE_CASE_LIGHT can be used in order to enable support for the case light in case there is a case light attached via the CASE_LIGHT_PIN.
  - Adding of support for M3060, which outputs the device type and the firmware version.
  - Adding of support for G80 and G81 Xx Yy Rr Zz Ff (= drilling).
  - FEATURE_HEAT_BED_TEMP_COMPENSATION can be used in order to compensate temperature drifts between the temperature sensor of the heating bed and the surface of the heating bed.
- The following issues from GitHub have been resolved:
  - #5 (after mounting of the SD card, the default menu item is "Print File"/"Mill File" now)
  - #14 (the offset of the z-axis was not set correctly after the Z-origin has been set)
  - #15, #16 (all pin definitions are within Pins.h now)
- For the RF2000 variant of the firmware, the following additional features have been added:
  - The pin definitions for the RF2000 board have been added.
  - Adding of support for the dual extruder.
  - Adding of support for three 24 FET outputs.
    - M3300 Pp Ss can be used in order to switch these outputs on/off.
  - Adding of support for three hardware PWM servo outputs.
    - M340 Pp Ss can be used in order to set the PWM interval.
  - Adding of support for one 230 V output.
    - M3301 Ss can be used in order to switch this output on/off.
  - Adding of support for RGB LEDs.
    - M3308 Pp can be used in order to switch the RGB mode between off, white, automatic and manual.
    - M3303 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used while the RF2000 is heating up
    - M3304 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used while the RF2000 is printing/milling
    - M3305 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used while the RF2000 is cooling down
    - M3306 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used while the RF2000 is idle
    - M3307 Pp Ss can be used in order to configure the RGB colors which shall be used for the manual RGB mode
    - In case the main screen is displayed, the leftmost hardware button can be pressed in order to toggle the RGB LEDs between the configured RGB mode and white.
  - Several texts and messages have been adapted in order to fit better to the bigger (20 columns instead of 16) display.
  - The SD card is detected automatically.
  - The always installed z-min and z-max endstops can be detected independently from each other.
- Additional minor improvements and corrections have been achieved during the review and clean-up of the firmware.

V 0.91.59 (2015-08-21)
- There were configurations where the milling did not continue after the search of the Z-origin.

V 0.91.57 (2015-08-13)
- Changing of the precision of the xxx_STEPS_PER_MM from long to float.
- Changing of MIN_EXTRUDER_TEMP from 160 to 120 °C (because a temperature of 120 °C can be used perfectly in order to remove/pull out the filament from the extruder).
- Adding of the AUTOMATIC_EEPROM_UPDATE, which allows to choose whether the EEPROM shall be updated directly after each change within the menu or only after "Store to EEPROM" has been called.
- Redefinition of SUPPORT_CURA to ALLOW_EXTENDED_COMMUNICATION.
  - Via this new define, all non-standard communication/messages from the firmware to the USB host can be disabled. Some applications/print servers may require to disable these non-standard messages.
- Improved configuration, recognitation and handling of the Z-endstop(s):
  - Adding of DEFAULT_Z_ENDSTOP_TYPE, ENDSTOP_TYPE_SINGLE and ENDSTOP_TYPE_CIRCUIT - these defines can be used in order to define whether only the Z-min, only the Z-max or both Z-endstops are installed.
  - Adding of UNKNOWN_Z_ENDSTOP_DRIVE_FREE_STEPS - this define can be used in order to define how many steps the RF1000 shall try to move when both Z-endstops are installed and one of them is pressed at the moment of the start of the firmware.
    - This moving allows the RF1000 to get out of the Z-endstop even when it does not know which of them was pressed.
  - In case the currently pressed Z-endstop is unknown, a homing in Z-direction must be performed before any other movement in Z-direction is allowed.
  - The type of the installed Z-endstops also can be configured via the menu (see "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Z Type").
- Homing is not allowed anymore while the RF1000 is doing a (heat bed/work part) scan and while it is searching the z-origin.
  - In addition, a homing in x and y direction is allowed only in case the RF1000 knows which Z-endstop is pressed (if any).
- Additional debug functionality has been added for the analysis of the heat bed scan and for the z-compensation.
- Calling of runStandardTasks() has been removed from moveZ() because with some G-Codes this call could cause the firmware to hang.

V 0.91.55 (2015-03-06)
- While a heat bed scan, work part scan or the finding of the origin is in progress, the following commands are ignored (except of an according log entry):
  - G0
  - G1
  - G2
  - G3
  - G28
- Sending of these commands could have a serious impact onto the ongoing scan/search because they could interfere with the movements from the scan/search.
- The ongoing heat bed scan / work part scan can be aborted faster now (e.g. through M3010).
- Fixing of a compiler error in case FEATURE_WORK_PART_Z_COMPENSATION was not enabled.
- The default value for FEATURE_CNC_MODE has been changed to 0 (= the CNC mode is not supported).
  - This change is a security measure because it is not known yet why the z-min endstops of multiple users were destroyed through after the upgrade to V 0.91.53.
  - For users which want to use the milling functionality of the RF1000 it is still possible to switch FEATURE_CNC_MODE back to 2.

V 0.91.53 (2015-02-25)
- Redefinition of prog_char in order to allow to compile the sources also with Arduino V 1.6.0.
  - This version of Arduino outputs a warning about "Low memory available" available memory, but this warning is misguided and can be ignored.
- Improved clean-up after the end/abort of a print from the SD card.
  - Previous versions of the firmware might have performed a small additional move into x and/or y-direction after the output of the object.
- In case the to-be-processed G-code from the SD card contained a non-ASCII character, the interpreter could switch from ASCII to binary - and as a result, it was not able to interpret the following G-code(s) properly.
- All micro (µ) signs have been replaced through a standard-u in order to avoid problems which occurred at some platforms.
- Removing of the support for M26, M92 and M251.
- M30 (delete file) can not be used anymore while the printing/milling from the SD card is in progress.
- Pausing via the menu of the RF1000 now works in the same way as the pausing via the hardware buttons.
- The z-compensation matrix is not loaded during the startup of the firmware anymore.
  - Instead, the z-compensation matrix is loading before it is needed the first time. This allows a significant faster startup of the firmware.
- The z-compensation works also for negative z-positions in the operating mode "mill".
- The setting of the x/y start and x/y end positions for the work part scan is more tolerant:
  - In case the new start position would be right and/or behind the current end position, the new start position is taken over and the end position is set to the same x/y position.
  - In case the new end position would be left and/or in front of the current start position, the new end position is taken over and the start position is set to the same x/y position.
- In case the current operating mode is not "print" but "mill", the firmware does not accept the commands for the configuration/reading of (heat bed and extruder) temperatures anymore.
- Improved handling of print and mill specific M-codes.
- Fine tuning of settings within Configuration.h:
  - The G-code script for the output of printed objects has been updated.
  - A separate G-code script has been introduced for the output of milled objects (see OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT_MILL).
- Review of menu texts.

V 0.91.51 (2015-01-14)
- It was possible to enable the z-compensation multiple times in case M3001 was sent multiple times in a certain order.
  - As a result, the z-compensation value could be applied multiple times because each new enabling of the z-compensation assumed the current z-position to be the not-compensated one.
- The recalculation of the current z-compensation value has been speeded up from 10 times to 1000 times per second.
  - This improvement reduces the number of z-axis steps which must be performed after each recalculation and as a result the z-axis is moved more smoothly.
- M3001 does not allow anymore to enable the z-compensation in case the home position of the z-axis is unknown.
- The z-axis correction now is being applied directly after M3001 has been sent, no matter whether another move into x or y direction has been performed already.
  - As always, the z-axis correction is applied only in case the current z-axis position is bigger than 0.

V 0.91.49 (2014-12-22)
- Adding of FEATURE_CNC_MODE.
  - When this #define is set to 2, the RF1000 can be switched between the "print" and the "mill" mode via its menu.
  - In this configuration, the additional z-max endstop can be used. This z-max endstop is connected in a circuit with the z-min endstop.
  - The default operating mode can be configured via the DEFAULT_OPERATING_MODE #define.
  - For now, it is not possible to move away from the pause position in mode "mill".
- Adding of FEATURE_FIND_Z_ORIGIN.
  - In operating mode "mill", the "Find Z=0" menu item can be used in order move the work bed upwards automatically until the current work part hits the current tool.
  - This position is used in order to set the origin in z-direction (Z=0).
  - FIND_Z_ORIGIN_SCRIPT can be used in order to configure a series of G-codes which is executed after the z-origin has been found.
 - Adding of M3006, which allows to specify the manual z-offset in [µm].
  - M3004 has been discarded (it allowed to specify the manual z-offset in [steps] previously).
- Adding of M3130, which allows to start/stop the search of the z-origin.
  - Calling of M3130 is identical to call of "Find Z=0" from the menu of the RF1000.
- EXT0_HOTEND_TYPE can be used now in order to configure which type of hotend is installed.
  - Depending to the chosen type, the default PID parameters are configured.
- Fixing of a compiler error in case CASE_FAN_PIN was set to -1.
- The minimal allowed step size for the heat bed/work part scan has been changed from 20 to 10 mm.
  - In case the minimal allowed step size is applied the startup of the firmware can be delayed by a few seconds because the reading of the z-compensation matrix needs more time.
- The additional moving operations (e.g. for the z-compensation and for the hardware buttons) have been moved from ISR(PWM_TIMER_VECTOR) to ISR(TIMER1_COMPA_vect).
  - The actual calculation of the z-compensation is done with less blocking of interrupts.
  - This modification should eliminate seldom communication errors (and as a result, short stops of the printing process) which could have occurred with previous versions.
- Fine tuning of settings within Configuration.h:
  - The default number of microsteps has been changed from 8 to 32.
  - OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT uses a slower z-axis speed now.

V 0.91.47 (2014-10-29)
- Adding of M3105, which allows to specify the movement after pause in [mm].
  - M3102 remains available and allows to specify the movement after pause in [steps].
- OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT has been extended so that the extruder retracts the filament after the stop of the print.
- After the heat bed scan the heating bed is moved down a little bit in order to avoid accidental collisions with the extruder during the next homing.
- In case the hardware button "Pause" was pressed during the homing of the printer, the firmware could end up in a hang.
- All heaters are turned off after the heat bed scan automatically.
- FEATURE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_POSITIONS has been set from 0 to 1 in order to allow to move all axes also when their home position is not known.
- In case the current movement after pause is bigger than the remaining distance in x/y/z direction, the printer moves until the min/max position.
  - Before this version, no movement into the according direction was performed in such a case.
- Cleanup of the delays for the external EEPROM.

V 0.91.45 (2014-10-17)
- The calculation of the z-compensation has been moved from the previously used interrupt routine to the main loop.
  - This was needed in order to avoid sporadic restarts of the firmware which occurred after the new micro step possibilities from V 0.91.39.

V 0.91.43 (2014-10-15)
- "Unmount Filament" has been renamed to "Unload Filament".
- "Mount Filament" has been renamed to "Load Filament".
- The homing-order at the beginning of the heat bed scan has been changed to the standard homing order.
- A wrong menu entry could appear at the end of the main menu (below "Configuration").

V 0.91.41 (2014-10-13)
- The automatic object output now can be configured via the OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT script.
  - M3104 has been removed because all of its functionality is replaced through the OUTPUT_OBJECT_SCRIPT script now.
- Adding of FEATURE_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_POSITIONS.
  - In case this #define is not 1, the "Position X/Y/Z" menu allows to move into the x/y/z direction only when the homing position is known.
- In case the "Position X/Y/Z" menu is used in order to change the position manually, the displayed position does not change anymore when the printer has reached its minimal/maximal position.
- Additional triggers to the watchdog have been added in order to avoid rare restarts of the Firmware in combination with higher numbers of microsteps.
- There was a chance that the temperature management was disabled while the firmware waited for the continue/pause position. As a result, the real temperatures could go above or drop below the desired temperatures.
- There was a chance that the x/y/z steppers were moved while the "Output Filament" or "Input Filament" operations were in progress.
- "Output Filament" has been renamed to "Unmount Filament".
  - OUTPUT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT has been changed to UNMOUNT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT.
- "Input Filament" has been renamed to "Mount Filament".
  - INPUT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT has been changed to MOUNT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT.
- The speed for the unmount of the filament after "Unmount Filament" has been increased.

V 0.91.39 (2014-10-10)
- Increasing of the access delay for the external EEPROM.
  - At some printers the previous delay was too short and as a result the z-compensation values could not be read/written properly.
- Adding of the "Input Filament" menu entry to the "Quick Settings" menu.
  - This operation can be used in order to input new filament to the extruder.
  - INPUT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT can be used in order to define the exact command sequence for the input of the filament.
- Fine tuning of various settings within Configuration.h:
  - new PID values for the extruder
  - new motor currents
  - correction of a DRV8711 register for better support of higher feedrates
  - ...
- Adding of RF1000_MICRO_STEPS which allows to switch the to-be-used micro steps between 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64.
  - The default value remains at 8 which is equal to the so-far-used micro steps.
  - Most position variables have been changed from short to long in order to support also the higher number of steps.
- The format of the compensation matrix has been changed so that the same compensation matrix can be used for different micro step settings.
  - There is no need anymore to perform a rescan after the to-be-used micro steps have been changed.
- In case the z-stepper was enabled via the hardware buttons it might not have been disabled ever.
- Redefinition of the hardware buttons for the z-direction:
  - In case printing is in progress, these hardware buttons can be used in order to fine-tune the z-position. There is no automatic increasing of the z-speed in case of this mode.
  - In case there is no printing in progress, these hardware buttons behave like the "Position Z" menu.
  - FEATURE_ENABLE_MANUAL_Z_SAFETY has been enabled in order to avoid an accidental overrun of the z-min endstop.
- There was a chance that not all steppers were disabled properly during the restart/reset of the firmware.

V 0.91.37 (2014-08-25)
- The case lights were not turned on/off when they were switched via the menu.
  - Removing of ENABLE_OUT1 (this pin is used for the case lights).
- Adding of support for the case fan.
  - The case fan is enabled automatically when the extruder heater is on.

- When the SD card is unmounted, the menu item selector is set correctly in front of the "Mount Card" menu item.
- Adding of the "Output Filament" menu entry to the "Quick Settings" menu.
  - This operation can be used in order to output the filament from the extruder.
  - OUTPUT_FILAMENT_SCRIPT can be used in order to define the exact command sequence for the output of the filament.

V 0.91.27 (2014-05-31)
- Calling of "Stop Print" while the printing was paused could hang the firmware.

V 0.91.25 (2014-05-22)
- In case the printing is aborted because of any reason, also the fan is turned off now.
- In case there is a printing from the SD card going on and a temperature sensor becomes defect, the printing is aborted.
  - This functionality can be turned on and off via the FEATURE_ABORT_PRINT_AFTER_TEMPERATURE_ERROR switch.
  - A printing via the PC is not affected by this functionality and the printer continues to run in dry mode like it did until now already.
- Adding of additional beeper outputs for various changes of the printer state:
  - start/abort/stop printing via the SD card
  - pause/continue printing
  - start/abort/stop heat bed scan
- The beeper can be turned on and off via the menu "Configuration" -> "General" -> "Beeper".
  - BEEPER_MODE from Configuration.h can be used in order to define whether the beeper shall be on or off by default.

- Optional emergency z-stop in order to detect a possible collision (extruder against heat bed).
  - This feature can be turned on via FEATURE_EMERGENCY_Z_STOP.
  - This feature can be configured via EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_DIGITS_MIN, EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_DIGITS_MAX, EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_INTERVAL and EMERGENCY_Z_STOP_CHECKS.

V 0.91.23 (2014-05-14)
- Removing of a possible value overflow in case very big values were assigned to OUTPUT_OFFSET_Z.
- Homing of an axis always sets previousMillisCmd to the current time in order to avoid that all steppers are disabled again directly after the homing.
  - In case of an operation like "Home all" via the menu of the printer, all steppers could become disabled before this change.
  - As a result, "Output Object" could not work (because per definition, it can work only in case the steppers are enabled and there was a homing since the last enabling of the steppers).

V 0.91.21 (2014-04-28)
- Improved clean-up and output of the object after a stop of the printing from the SD card.
- Minor clean-ups and corrections.

V 0.91.19 (2014-04-17)
- Moving of the z-axis via the hardware buttons supports acceleration and allows faster speeds now.
- Manual outputting of filament (via the Host software and/or via the hardware button) could cause an unwanted emergency pause.
- When the printing is paused, the extruder current is lowered now.
  - EXTRUDER_CURRENT_PAUSED can be used in order to configure the to-be-used current while the printing is paused.

- In case the printing via the SD card is active, the quick menu provides the "Stop Print" entry now which can be used in order to cancel the print.
- The order of the entries within the quick settings menu has been changed.
- Stopping of the print via the menu now also disables all heaters, outputs the object and disables all steppers.
  - All steppers are disabled also after a manual "Output Object".
- Improved initialization of the display.

V 0.91.17 (2014-03-27)
- Correcting of the comments about the DRV8711 register settings.

V 0.91.15 (2014-03-26)
